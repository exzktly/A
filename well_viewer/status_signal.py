"""Global status-light state registry.

The bottom-left ``StatusDot`` in the all-well window reflects the app's
mood at a glance:

* ``success`` (green)  — idle, dataset loaded.
* ``neutral`` (grey)   — idle, no dataset loaded.
* ``accent``  (blue)   — at least one background worker is running
                          (e.g. ``GatingWorker``, ``_AutoThresholdWorker``,
                          ``_load_path``).
* ``warn``    (yellow) — a synchronous GUI repaint is in flight (the app
                          may feel briefly unresponsive).
* ``danger``  (red)    — the most recent operation failed; auto-clears
                          after ``DANGER_HOLD_SECS`` seconds.

The actual ``StatusDot`` widget lives on ``AllWellApp``; this module is
the plumbing that lets any module deep in the package push/pop a busy /
warn scope and trigger the danger pulse, without taking a hard
dependency on ``all_well.py`` (and without circular imports).

``AllWellApp`` calls :func:`register_driver` at startup with a callable
that accepts a state string. Until that runs every call here is a
silent no-op, so unit tests / standalone widget demos that don't
construct the main window are unaffected.

Reference counts let multiple workers / repaints overlap cleanly: the
effective state is picked in priority order
``danger > accent > warn > (success | neutral)`` so a brief warn
during a redraw doesn't mask an in-progress worker, and a failure
sticks out red over everything else.
