"""Cell-override persistence (``<data_dir>/cell_overrides.json``).

Stores Segmentation tab include/exclude patches for individual cells. Writes
are debounced via ``schedule_save`` to coalesce bursts of toggles into a
single disk write.

Schema v2 adds a per-well **segmentation fingerprint** so re-running the
pipeline (which re-allocates nucleus label IDs from 1) doesn't cause
overrides to silently re-bind to unrelated cells. The fingerprint is the
``<well>_out.zip`` mtime captured at the time the override was set; a
stored entry whose fingerprint no longer matches the on-disk zip is
discarded with a warning.

v1 files (no fingerprint) load with a warning telling the user their
overrides may be stale if the pipeline has been re-run since the
overrides were last saved.
