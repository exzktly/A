"""Consolidated viewer-state document (``<data_dir>/persistence.json``).

Holds one section per viewer-owned persistence domain so the data directory
carries a single file instead of three small sidecars. Currently houses
``ratios``, ``heatmap_layouts``, and ``line_order``. ``cell_overrides`` stays
in its own file (size + write-frequency); ``pipeline_info.json`` is owned by
the batch pipeline and is left alone.

A ``view_state`` section is added by ``view_state.py`` for live UI selections.

Migration: on first read, any legacy sidecars present in the data directory
are absorbed into a fresh ``persistence.json`` and then deleted.
