"""Scope registry + dirty-flag plumbing for fold-change tabs.

Pure logic (no Qt) so the helpers can be unit-tested without spinning
up a PySide6 environment. Each fold-change-aware tab registers a
``FoldChangeScope`` describing how to find its combo widgets and which
``WellViewerApp`` method to call when its plot needs to redraw. The
``redraw_scopes_or_defer`` / ``flush_dirty_scopes`` pair implements
the 'only redraw the visible tab; redraw the rest when the user looks
at them' optimization without coupling either tab to the other.

The Qt-facing fold-change controls module (`tabs.fold_change_controls`)
re-exports these names so existing callers don't change.
