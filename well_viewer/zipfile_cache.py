"""Process-wide LRU cache of open :class:`zipfile.ZipFile` handles.

Used by ``preview_controller.read_member_bytes``,
``preview_controller.scan_zip_members``, ``smfish_worker._process_well``,
and ``image_table_controller`` to share a single open file handle across
all member reads on the same well zip.

Why: an Image Table at e.g. 4 × 6 cells with two channel variants performs
~50 individual zip-member reads. The previous code opened the zip (parsing
the central directory) once per read — multi-MB zips on a network mount
turned that into a measurable lag on every Generate / auto-LUT / export
cycle.

Thread safety
-------------
``zipfile.ZipFile.read(member)`` is not concurrency-safe — two threads
calling ``.read()`` on the same handle corrupt each other. The cache
guards each handle with a per-handle :class:`threading.Lock`, so callers
can use the same handle from multiple threads as long as they go through
``with_handle()``. Concurrent reads on *different* handles run in
parallel.
