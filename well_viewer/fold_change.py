"""Fold-change normalization helpers for the Bar and Line plot tabs.

Two independent modes are supported and may be combined:

1. ``vs control`` — every bar / curve is divided by the control well's
   (or replicate-set's) mean at the same timepoint.
2. ``vs t0``     — every bar / curve is divided by its own value at the
   earliest available timepoint (each member's own baseline).

The helpers operate on aggregation-point ("AggPoint") tuples produced by
``aggregate_with_threshold_df`` / ``_aggregate_well`` / ``_aggregate_group``:

    (t, mean, spread, frac, n_above, n_total,
     frac_spread?, n_above_pf_mean?, n_above_pf_spread?)

Only ``mean`` and its ``spread`` field are rescaled; fractions, counts and
per-FOV spreads of counts are left untouched (they're not interpretable as
fold-change). The transform returns new tuples with the same arity.

Stacking order: when both axes are active, ``vs t0`` is applied to the
post-control values. The final value is::

    Y(t) = (X(t) / C(t)) / (X(0) / C(0))

i.e. the ΔΔCt-style ratio-of-ratios, not ``(X(t) / X(0)) / (C(t) / C(0))``.
The two forms are NOT equivalent in general; the docstring of
``normalize_pts`` carries the math.

Error propagation: each fold-change denominator (control mean, t0
baseline) is divided through with its OWN spread, and the resulting
relative error combines in quadrature:

    (σ_Y / Y)² = (σ_X / X)² + (σ_C / C)² + (σ_B / B)²    (B = t0)

The relevant helpers (``scale_bar_value``, ``normalize_pts``) accept
denominator spreads via ``control_spread`` / ``t0_spread`` /
``control_stats``. When a denominator spread isn't supplied it
defaults to 0 (the "treat as exact" behaviour) — that's still the
backwards-compatible mode and matches the unit tests' simpler form.
``member_stats_series`` / ``control_stats_at_for_bar`` return both
mean and spread so the plot tab and line tab pick up the full
propagation automatically.

Statistical consistency: ``member_mean_series`` and
``control_mean_at_for_bar`` resolve the control's mean using the SAME
statistic the displayed bar / curve uses — mean-of-per-well-means for
rep-set members (via ``_compute_rep_stats`` / ``_compute_rep_per_fov_stats``),
single-well aggregation for well members. Mixing statistics across
numerator and denominator gave biased ratios in the original
implementation; that's fixed here.
