"""Batch-export line collector — analogue of ``collect_bar_items_for_group``.

The on-tab line plot iterates ``app._rep_sets_active()`` + selected wells;
the batch line exporter iterates a ``BarGroup`` (members + solo wells).
This module bridges the two — it builds :class:`LineSeries` records for
a single batch group using the same per-trace stats the on-tab plot
uses, with one important deviation: rep-set members in the batch path
aggregate via ``_aggregate_group`` (pool-of-cells), matching the
existing batch line CSV's prior behaviour. The plot-tab side uses
``_compute_rep_stats`` (mean-of-per-well-means). The cross-path
numerator difference is a pre-existing issue acknowledged in
ARCHITECTURE.md §9.5 and outside this refactor's scope.

Fold-change is applied via the same helpers
(``control_pts_for_line`` → ``control_means``-style normalization),
threaded through the panel-local ``fc_state`` so a batch job is
isolated from whatever the plot-tab ctxbar has picked.
