"""Custom widgets for the All-Well v2 UI.

See ``design/PORT_PLAN.md`` Table 2 for the catalog and rationale. Every widget
in this package is styled exclusively from the tokens in the repo-root ``theme``
module, is DPI-aware (sizes derive from font metrics / logical units, never
hardcoded device pixels), and ships a ``__main__`` block that opens it in a
small standalone window for visual QA.

Import widgets directly from their modules, e.g.::

    from widgets.toggle_switch import ToggleSwitch

or run a module directly to preview it::

    python widgets/toggle_switch.py
