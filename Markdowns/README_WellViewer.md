# All-Well

All-Well is a desktop application for fluorescence-microscopy quantification
and analysis. It bundles a StarDist-based segmentation pipeline and an
interactive multi-channel data viewer into a single window, so you can take a
plate of raw images all the way to publication-ready plots without leaving
the app.

## What you get

- **Analyze tab.** A form-driven launcher for the StarDist nuclear-segmentation
  pipeline. Pick an input folder, set the filename schema and channel tokens,
  pick a segmentation method, hit Run. The pipeline streams its log into the
  window and writes per-well CSVs plus per-well processed-image ZIPs to your
  output directory.
- **Review tab.** Open the output folder and explore: an 8×12 plate-map well
  picker, line / bar / scatter / distribution / heat-map plots, an image
  table for thumbnail comparison, a per-FOV segmentation reviewer with cell
  editing, an smFISH spot-detection view, pairwise statistics, batch export
  to CSV + figures.
- **One window, one dataset folder.** Analyze writes a folder; Review opens
  it. The hand-off is automatic when an Analyze run completes successfully.
- **Persistence baked in.** Channel-threshold defaults, saved selections,
  ratio metrics, heat-map layouts, per-cell `Included` overrides, and figure
  styling all live next to your data in `pipeline_info.json` and a small set
  of sibling JSON files; reopening the folder restores everything.

## Install

### macOS pre-built app

If someone handed you `AllWell.app` (typically inside `AllWell-mac.zip`),
nothing else is required — the bundle ships its own Python + every
dependency.

1. Unzip; move `AllWell.app` to `/Applications` (optional).
2. The first time you launch it, macOS may complain it's "damaged" because
   the bundle is unsigned. Clear the quarantine attribute and re-sign with
   an ad-hoc signature:
   ```sh
   xattr -cr /Applications/AllWell.app
   codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/AllWell.app
   ```
3. Double-click to launch.

About **4 GB free RAM** is recommended for StarDist inference. On Apple
Silicon the bundled `tensorflow-metal` uses the GPU automatically.

### Running from source

You'll need:

- **Miniforge** (or another conda/mamba distribution). On Apple Silicon:
  ```sh
  curl -LO https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh
  bash Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh
  ```
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (Apple Silicon, for native wheel builds):
  ```sh
  xcode-select --install
  ```

Create the environment. The version pins here matter — most of the post-pin
ones are because TensorFlow 2.13 (the macOS-Metal build) won't accept newer
NumPy or `setuptools`:

```sh
mamba create -n allwell python=3.10.14 setuptools=69.5.1 \
    "numpy>=1.24,<1.25" scipy scikit-image matplotlib pillow imageio h5py \
    -c conda-forge -y
mamba activate allwell
```

Verify `pkg_resources` works before going further (if it doesn't, you've got
a too-new `setuptools` — see Troubleshooting):

```sh
python -c "import pkg_resources; print('OK')"
```

Install the pip-managed packages. **Always pass `--no-build-isolation`** so
pip honours the mamba-managed pins above:

```sh
pip install --no-build-isolation -r _Docs/requirements.txt
```

On Apple Silicon, confirm TensorFlow sees the Metal GPU:

```sh
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
# expected: [PhysicalDevice(name='/physical_device:GPU:0', device_type='GPU')]
```

Run it:

```sh
python all_well.py
python all_well.py --data_dir /path/to/results   # pre-load a dataset
```

The pipeline alone (no GUI) can be invoked directly — useful for CI or
batch processing on headless workers:

```sh
python process_microscopy.py --help
```

---

## Quick start

A common end-to-end run, from raw images to plots, takes five clicks:

1. Launch the app and switch to **Analyze** (title-bar segmented control).
2. **Open input folder** — point at the folder of raw TIFs (or a folder of
   per-well ZIPs).
3. Fill the schema and channel tokens. Click **Run**.
4. When the log prints "Processing complete" the app auto-switches to
   **Review** and loads the output folder.
5. Pick wells in the plate map; the plots redraw immediately.

Reopen a previous output folder any time with the `Open…` button in Review
or `Ctrl+O`.

---

## Analyze mode — running the pipeline

The Analyze tab is one tall scrollable form. Top to bottom:

### 1. Filename schema

A colon-separated list of field names, applied left-to-right against the
underscore-separated tokens in each filename. The `Schema string` field is
editable directly; the picker chips above it mirror it.

Recognised field names: `experiment`, `channel`, `well`, `fov`, `timepoint`,
`ignore`.

- `channel` and `well` are **required** and must appear exactly once.
- `fov` is optional — single-FOV acquisitions work fine without it.
- `ignore` consumes a token without using it (e.g. an experiment-version
  prefix).

The well token is normalised: `A1` and `A01` mean the same well.

**Common examples:**

| Filename | Schema | Sep |
|---|---|---|
| `Exp01_NIR_B03_F001_02d04h30m.tif` | `experiment:channel:well:fov:timepoint` | `_` |
| `A1_w1_T01.tif` | `well:channel:timepoint` | `_` |
| `Scan-A01-0001-GFP.tif` | `ignore:well:fov:channel` | `-` |
| `A01_DAPI.tif` | `well:channel` | `_` |

**Timepoint formats** the pipeline parses to hours:

```
DDdHHhMMm   02d04h30m → 52.5 h
Standalone  48h, 2d, 30m, 90min
Pure number 24 or 1.5  (interpreted as hours)
Prefixed    T01, day2, tp_3  (numeric suffix → ordinal)
Any string  preserved as-is and sorted lexicographically
```

### 2. Channel tokens

- **Nuclear (segmentation) channel.** The token used to find the image
  StarDist runs against (also gets quantified — its intensities appear in
  the CSV like any other channel).
- **Fluorescent channels.** One or more tokens whose intensities you want
  quantified. Each token gets its own CSV column set (`<token>_mean_intensity`,
  `<token>_total_intensity`, etc.).
- **smFISH channels** (optional). Channels processed for spot detection.
  Each smFISH channel appears with both a regular intensity column set and
  a `_smfish_count` column.

### 3. Folders

The input folder is resolved by
[`services/input_resolution_service.py`](../services/input_resolution_service.py):

- A folder named `in/` → input = that folder, output = `../out`.
- A folder containing an `in/` subfolder → use it, output = `../out`.
- A folder of loose TIFs → `WellPlateZipper` is invoked to group them into
  per-well ZIPs according to your schema, then the pipeline runs against
  those.
- A folder of per-well ZIPs already → used directly.

You can also explicitly override the output folder.

### 4. Pipeline options

- **Segmentation method.** `stardist_nuclei` (default — segment nuclei
  only), `stardist_seeded_watershed_cell` (StarDist nuclei + watershed
  cytoplasm segmentation).
- **Cytoplasm token** (only used by the seeded-watershed method).
- **Top-hat radii.** Nuclear and per-fluor radii in pixels. `0` or
  `--no_tophat_*` flags disable per-channel.
- **Min nucleus area** in pixels (rejects garbage detections).

### 5. Compute options

- **TF threads.** TensorFlow intra-op parallelism (CPU only; ignored on
  Metal). Defaults to 4.
- **Workers.** Number of wells processed in parallel.
  - On Apple Silicon Metal the default is 2 — Metal serialises GPU calls
    across processes, so more workers don't help GPU throughput.
  - CPU-only: defaults to `floor((cpu_count − 1) / tf_threads)`.
- **CPU-only.** Forces TensorFlow to ignore the GPU.
- **Force re-run.** Re-processes wells whose output ZIPs already exist.

### 6. Run / Stop / Log

- Click **Run**. The log streams the pipeline's stdout/stderr live.
- **Stop** signals the entire pipeline process group (sub-workers
  included).
- On success the app switches to Review and loads the output folder.

### What the pipeline writes

```
<output_dir>/
├── <well>_out.zip          ← masks + tophat-corrected fluorescence + overlays
├── <prefix>_<well>.csv     ← per-well measurement CSV (one row per nucleus)
├── pipeline_info.json      ← schema + channel tokens + FOVs + timepoints +
│                              gating thresholds + saved selections, etc.
└── (transient tmp_<well>/  ← deleted on success)
```

---

## Review mode — exploring results

Open a results folder with the Open button (or `Ctrl+O`, or
`python all_well.py --data_dir <path>`). The viewer accepts:

- A folder of per-well CSVs (flat).
- A folder containing an `out/` subfolder of CSVs.
- A folder with both `in/` (source ZIPs) and `out/` (results).

Per-well image ZIPs (`<well>_out.zip`) are discovered on demand when an
image-using tab is open. `pipeline_info.json` is read on every open and
keeps the viewer in sync with the schema + channel tokens.

### The Review tabs

The left-rail "SECTION" navigator selects one of the centre tabs:

| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|---------------|
| **Plotting** | Five sub-tabs: **Line Graphs** (mean ± SD/SEM + fraction above threshold + CDF), **Bar Plots** (bar / beeswarm / violin, drag-to-reorder), **Scatter Plot** (per-cell scatter and aggregate scatter), **Distribution** (histogram / KDE / violin of per-cell values at one timepoint), **Heat Map** (custom layout heatmap). |
| **Statistics** | Pairwise tests across saved selections (t-test, Mann-Whitney, KS) with KS CDF. |
| **Image Table** | Grid of per-FOV image thumbnails; configurable rows/columns/channels; bulk export. |
| **Segmentation** | Two sub-tabs: **Segmentation** (per-FOV overlay viewer; click a nucleus to flag/unflag it for inclusion in stats) and **smFISH** (spot detection, parameter sweep, "Apply to All"). |
| **Review CSV** | Tabular view of the loaded per-well CSVs; supports filtering, jumping to the Segmentation tab for any row. |
| **Sample Definitions** | Saved-selection / replicate-set editor. Includes a **Cell Gating** sub-section for per-channel inclusion-threshold defaults. |
| **Batch Export** | Define export groups (or use the Sample Definitions groups), pick timepoints, run a bulk export of CSVs + figures + ZIPs. |

### Channel selector

The single channel dropdown at the top of every plotting sub-tab is shared
across the whole window — picking a different channel re-renders every
plot, every axis label, every threshold range, and every export against
the new channel. Ratio channels (e.g. `GFP/MCHERRY`) defined under the
Sample Definitions ratio editor appear here as virtual channels.

### Plate-map well picker

The 8×12 plate map in the left sidebar drives every plot and table. Click
a well to toggle it; drag across wells to multi-toggle; click a row letter
or column number to toggle the whole row / column; **Select all** /
**Select none** clear or fill in one click. The selection survives across
tabs and is what every plot / aggregate / export consumes.

### Properties (figure styling)

The **Properties** button on each plot tab's controls row opens a slide-out
sidebar that styles the active figure: axis label / tick / title sizes,
grid on/off + alpha + linestyle, legend, line / marker widths, axis
limits + log-scale, layout engine, and an export-profile picker. Settings
are per-figure and persist across redraws.

### Saved figures and CSV exports

Every plot tab carries the same action buttons on its controls row:

- **Export CSV** — writes the underlying data behind the current plot.
- **Copy SVG** — puts a vector copy of the figure on the clipboard
  (paste into Illustrator / Inkscape / Keynote / Slides).
- **Save figure** — saves to disk; the file dialog picks the format from
  the extension (`.svg` / `.pdf` / `.eps` / `.png`).
- **Properties** — opens the styling sidebar described above.

### Batch export

Define one or more groups (replicate sets + solo wells), pick a set of
timepoints, and the Batch Export tab generates one figure + one CSV per
group per timepoint into a folder of your choosing. Useful for paper
figures where every condition needs the same plot at the same time
points.

---

## Filename schema

The schema is a colon-separated list of field names applied left-to-right
to filename tokens (split on the chosen separator). See
[Analyze mode → Filename schema](#1-filename-schema) above for the
recognised field names and worked examples.

`pipeline_info.json` records the schema you ran the pipeline with, so the
viewer doesn't need you to re-enter it.

---

## CSV output format

One CSV per well, one row per nucleus. Standard columns:

```
filename, experiment, channel, well, fov, timepoint, timepoint_hours
nucleus_id, area_px, Included
<token>_total_intensity      ← one set per quantified channel
<token>_mean_intensity
<token>_max_intensity
<token>_min_intensity
<token>_std_intensity
<token>_smfish_count          ← only if <token> is configured as smFISH
```

`<token>` is the lowercase channel token (`gfp`, `mcherry`, `w2turq`, …).
The nuclear/segmentation channel is also quantified, so it appears as a
normal channel in viewer selectors.

`Included` is `0` or `1` and starts as the cell-gating-default verdict;
the Segmentation tab and the Cell Gating sub-section let you override it
per cell, with overrides persisted to `cell_overrides.json` next to the
CSVs.

---

## Performance and GPU usage

The pipeline spawns one worker per well, up to a configurable maximum. Each
worker loads StarDist once and reuses it across every FOV in that well.

- **Apple Silicon (Metal) — the default.** Workers default to 2. Metal
  serialises GPU calls across processes; more workers do not improve GPU
  throughput, they only add RAM pressure. Two workers overlap I/O and
  CPU preprocessing with GPU inference.
- **CPU-only.** Workers default to `floor((cpu_count − 1) / tf_threads)`,
  with `tf_threads` defaulting to 4. Adjust under Compute Options if your
  machine has very many cores.

Temporary directories (`_tmp_extract_*`, `_tmp_images_*`) are removed when
each well completes, even after a worker error. Stragglers from a crashed
run are cleaned up at the start of the next run.

---

## Building the macOS bundle

PyInstaller produces a binary for the host architecture; the build itself
must run on a Mac. The `allwell` mamba environment must be active.

```sh
mamba activate allwell
chmod +x _Docs/_Installation/build_all_well.sh
_Docs/_Installation/build_all_well.sh
```

The finished bundle lands at `dist/AllWell.app`. To distribute it:

```sh
cd dist && zip -r AllWell-mac.zip AllWell.app
```

For a Universal binary (Intel + Apple Silicon in one bundle):

```sh
TARGET_ARCH=universal2 _Docs/_Installation/build_all_well.sh
```

This needs a `universal2` Python from python.org — the Miniforge Python is
architecture-specific and can't produce a universal binary.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`AllWell.app is damaged and can't be opened.`** — macOS quarantine on
an unsigned bundle. Fix:
```sh
xattr -cr /Applications/AllWell.app
codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/AllWell.app
```

**The app opens and immediately closes.** — Run the bundle from a terminal
to see the actual error:
```sh
dist/AllWell.app/Contents/MacOS/AllWell 2>&1 | head -100
```

**`No module named 'pkg_resources'`.** — `setuptools` was upgraded past v70
in the mamba environment. Recreate the environment from scratch. Don't
`pip install setuptools` and don't `mamba update --all`.

**`No GPU device found` / TensorFlow not using Metal.** — Install
`tensorflow-metal`:
```sh
pip install tensorflow-metal==1.1.0
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
```

**Segmentation / smFISH / Image Table show "No images found".** — Check
that your results directory contains `<well>_out.zip` files. The viewer
reads top-hat-filtered fluorescence (`*_tophat.tif`), masks
(`*_labels.tif`), overlays (`*_overlay.png`), and smFISH-processed
channels (`*_smfish.tif`) from inside those ZIPs. If channel tokens differ
from what the viewer expected, re-open the directory — `pipeline_info.json`
is re-read on every open.

**Auto-threshold reports `timepoint unknown`.** — `pipeline_info.json`
doesn't have a schema that names a `tp` or `timepoint` field. Re-run the
pipeline with the correct `--filename_schema` so the JSON sidecar carries
the right field map.

**Bar-plot timepoint dropdown is empty.** — Either no wells are selected,
or the CSVs don't have a `timepoint_hours` column. Confirm the schema you
ran the pipeline with included a `timepoint` field. Single-timepoint
experiments show one entry (e.g. `0`).

**`WellPlateZipper` produces no zip files.** — Schema or separator does
not match the filenames. Make sure `well` points at the right token, the
separator is right, and the token is a valid plate position (`A01`–`H12`
or `A1`–`H12`). The schema used is logged at the start of every run.

**StarDist model download fails (SSL error).** — Pre-download the model on
an unrestricted machine and copy `~/.keras/models/` across.

**`No module named 'stardist'` in the built app.** — The build forgot the
PyInstaller hooks. Make sure `_Docs/_Installation/hooks/` (notably
`hook-stardist.py`) was on the spec path.

**The built bundle is > 900 MB.** — Normal. TensorFlow + Numba + LLVMLite
+ SciPy + Matplotlib account for the bulk.

**Channel dropdown shows a different channel than the plot.** — Should be
fixed; if you ever see it again it means the active channel state and the
combo got out of sync. Refresh the dataset (Open the same folder again).
