"""Tests for ``barplot_controller.collect_bar_items`` + math consistency.

The key regression: when a rep-set is used as its own fold-change
control, the corresponding bar's value must be exactly 1.0. Before the
math fix in PR 3 this was off by the ratio between mean-of-per-well-means
and pool-of-cells, both of which the helpers were mixing. With the
``member_mean_series`` fix the same statistic appears on both sides of
the ratio and the round-trip is exact.
