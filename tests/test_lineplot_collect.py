"""Tests for ``lineplot_controller.collect_line_series``.

Pure-logic tests using the MockApp fixture from conftest.py — verifies
the line plot's single-source-of-truth collector emits the right
LineSeries shape for rep-set and per-well modes, honours drag order,
and applies fold-change once (matching the math-consistency invariant
from PR 3).
